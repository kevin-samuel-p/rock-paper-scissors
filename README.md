# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in C++. Players compete against the computer in a best-of-N match, with an automatic tiebreaker system if the final score is tied.

## Features
- Play against a computer opponent.
- Choose between quick math or best-of-3/best-of-5.
- Automatic tiebreaker round if necessary.
- Tracks and displays the score after each round.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Input the match format (`1` for Single Match, `2` for Best-of-3, or `3` for Best-of-5, etc.).
3. Choose `r` (Rock), `p` (Paper), or `s` (Scissors) for each round.
4. The computer will randomly select its move.
5. The winner of each round is displayed, along with the current score.
6. If the final round results in a tie, a tiebreaker round is automatically triggered.
